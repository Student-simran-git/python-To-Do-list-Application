📝 To-Do List Application (Python)

A simple console-based To-Do List application created using Python.
This program allows users to add, view, and remove tasks.
Tasks are saved in a text file, so they remain even after closing the program.

✨ Features

Add new tasks

View all tasks

Remove tasks by number

Tasks stored permanently using a text file

Simple and user-friendly CLI interface

📌 How It Works

Tasks are stored in a file named tasks.txt.

When the program starts, it loads existing tasks from the file.

Any new changes (add/remove) are updated and saved back to the file.

🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Save the file as todo.py.
3. Run the program using:
python todo.py

📂 File Structure

todo.py       → Main Python program
tasks.txt     → Stores your tasks (auto-created)
README.md     → Project documentation
